BRO: Batch ROI Overlay
==================

**BRO** is an *ImageJ* Plugin which applies RoiSets saved using the ImageJ RoiManager to their corresponding image files and then saves a flattened composite as a .png

BRO was created by Dylan Terstege, a Neuroscience PhD candidate in the Epp Lab at the University of Calgary.
